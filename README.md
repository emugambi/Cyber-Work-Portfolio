Introduction

The bulk of the work I did as a cyber security data scientist involved developing machine learning-based detections for a plethora of  use cases.  I worked in various cybersecurity firms - Devo (https://www.devo.com), a cloud-based SIEM product that has been used globally since 2014, Fortinet -  a firewall and networking global company in business since 1992 and Symantec - a world-renowned anti-virus company that was acquired by Broadcom.
AI/Machine Learning is needed in cyber security for various reasons:
(1) desist from relying on static rule-base detections which are known to be weak, degrade over time, can be easily deceived by hackers and, are known to lead to lots of false alarms.
(2) assist SOC teams by developing intelligent modules that can correlate many signals which reduces the laborious manual dredging required to investigate incidents and minimizes
false alarms.
(3) machine learning models can be constantly updated in a feedback loop to ensure they don’t lose their edge over time compared to static rules.
(4) automation of cyber security processes is a must-have to alleviate the scarcity of cybersecurity skills and personnel and it's the only way we’ll be able to bend the curve against cyberattackers.
Some of the solutions we built were geared towards identifying anomalous behavior or extracting high-level intelligence that can be used to shed more light on the security posture of the network.
The list below contains many of the  use cases that I worked on during my most recent role. The folders contained in this directory hold samples of the code developed for some of the use cases highlighted in the following link -
